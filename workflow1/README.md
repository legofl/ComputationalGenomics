### Workflow Assignment #1
This is the repo for my workflow assignment #1

I have included one set of paired fastq files in the data folder.

Run 'workflow1.nf' by:
`nextflow run workflow1.nf`

Required dependencies I installed in my conda environment to run 'workflow1.nf':
- trimmomatic
- spades (Python must be version 2.7 to run spades)
- bioconda
- nextflow
